    <h2>About kifuniko</h2>

    <p>
        ​kifuniko look has been described many ways. He has been called “monkey dog” and “ape terrier.” My family says diablotin moustachu (“mustached little devil”), and Star Wars fans argue whether he looks more like a Wookie or an Ewok.

        Standing less than a foot tall, this sturdy terrier-like dog approaches life with great confidence. “This isn’t a breed you train,” a professional dog handler tells us, “He’s like a human. You befriend him.” The dense, harsh coat is described as “neat but shaggy” and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. He can be willful and domineering, but mostly kifuniko is loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. my family says they love being owned by their little monkey dog.
